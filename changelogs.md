### v1.1.0 
Single User Authentication Addition
- Commit Sha: 2638bf02b55a38649a7b91efb7d1175ac92559e5
- Deploy Version: Version 22 on Mar 16, 7:46 AM
- Permanent URL Version ID(25): `AKfycbwu9tQSLZ-AXYs8h6nVuqxb_zdi6gmHnjPKOw4udfGGNybtTGAk8rKiFIHIxkZhog0uIQ`
- Client Side `Gasup_v1.1.0.js` 
- Updated
  - Client side gets addition of `app` as a top level parameter in requests, same level as scope & request
    - This is only for passwords and app names at this point
  - Autentication for Public and Single User apps! 
    - First basic implimentation of this, we had to create and generate a developerMetadata object to relay info from library to sheet user.
    - Public is just as before, but with that variable set
    - Single User uses 1 password and can alway make read gsheet and read "specified" sheets public
- NOTES:
  - We created a placeholder for "users" the third option for authentication and most complicated. But still needs to be built, if ever.
  - Single User's publicRequests is also incomplete. Maybe add rows and public `update` requests down the line....
