# GAS Stack (Github, Google Authentication, App Scripts and Sheets)
If you're a front-end developer looking to prototype with logins, databases and APIs: consider some GAS. This light weight (and uh, free(..well, save for the yearly domain payment)) Stack gives you everything you need to build out a fully functional data-driven user account incorporated application.

#### It's all driven through your gmail google drive account.
* DBs: Google sheets
* API: Lies in sheets as Google's App Scripts.
* Authentication: Create a new app on google developer console and plug in your keys to your front-end code.
