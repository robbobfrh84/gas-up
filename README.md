# gas-stack (Google App Scripts with Google Sheets for data storage)
If you're a front-end developer looking to prototype with logins, databases and APIs: consider some GAS. This is a light weight (and uh, free) way to create **live** full-stack web application.

#### It's all driven through your gmail google drive account.
* Data Storage: Google sheets
* API: Lives in the Google sheet's App Scripts ( Tool > Script Editor ).
* See: [Documentation](https://github.com/robbobfrh84/gas-stack/tree/master/_documention) for a getting started guide.

- {!BOBðŸ‘€} Move to `Tutorials_Examples` when finished.
