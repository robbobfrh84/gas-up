### Next 3-ish ✅

- Review clasp cli development
- Get all it working for tester_kitchen_sink
- You're using gas-stack-create for tester_kitchen_sink, let's make it's own sheet.
- Once basic flow is set, move gas-stack-create to shed
  - Make sure the readme is desolved.

### Dev To Do...
- ✅Create  `/tester` & `/tester/tester_kitchen_sink.html`
- handle Delete sheet

### Admin To Do...
- Rebrand repo: decide on name(s) and update repo wide.
  - I say stick with gas-stack its more memorable. NOTE: gas-db_v1.0 (change?)
