# GAS Up starter (client-side code)
⚠️ NOTE: This code is a TEMPLATE that will be filled in by the Google Apps Script code.
- SO!, it will not work if you open the `index.html`
- AND!, it will not be a PART OF the generated code. So, just a reference for dev-gas-up.
- See: https://github.com/robbobfrh84/gas-up/wiki/getting-started for user docs.
