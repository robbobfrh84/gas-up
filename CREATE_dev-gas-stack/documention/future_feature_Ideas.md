### Things I know I'd like to add...
- Google User Account Auth
- Add photos. I know you can upload photos into cells. So maybe there's an easy way to handle that within the GAS docs...
- Cron Job control

### Things that could be options to think about
- Connecting Firebase in some way for realtime games and things...
- Serving client from GAS script.
- Have a calender sheet that does cron job stuff. This might need to be connect to a google app engine. which is fine!
