...ðŸ¤” clasp dev run is pretty thorough so far...
- I think i'm realizing that the way I build out the gas stack originally might not make since anymore. I may want to just redo it from scratch...
- This sounds crazy, but it would allow me to document all the google 'docs' methods that are used in a more useful way... Like, how I do in `spa` more notes and opened up.
- So, I can start all over again by creating the github repo and building out from scratch. gas-stack_v1.0.gs, gas-stack_v1.0.js,

Thoughts on name...
- The long name in the header is nice, but i still like gas-stack. it just rolls of the tongue. but i want to say "Google Apps Script & Sheet Data Storage"
