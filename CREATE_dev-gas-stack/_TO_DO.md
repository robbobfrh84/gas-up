### Next 3-ish ✅

- Do quick_api_guide -> Move to Tutorials_Examples...
- Review clasp cli development
- Get all it working for tester_kitchen_sink
- You're using gas-stack-create for tester_kitchen_sink, let's make it's own sheet.
- Once basic flow is set, move `gas-stack-create` to shed
  - Make sure the readme is desolved. You've got some notes you may want to move.
  - find `__dev/gas-stack` home for gsheet

### Dev To Do...
- ✅Create  `/tester` & `/tester/tester_kitchen_sink.html`
- handle Delete sheet

### Admin To Do...
- Rebrand repo: decide on name(s) and update repo wide.
  - I say stick with gas-stack its more memorable. NOTE: gas-db_v1.0 (change?)
  - Then, you could make gas-stack_v1.0, rather than 2.0?

# gas-stack Goals

Dev work cycle:
- Setup a development workflow that's well documented for you in future.

Auth:
- See `auth diagram.jpg`
- Sign up with email, change password, forgot password

GAS Class: Features
- update to fetch...
- retry if request fails, like in the case where greg had to refresh.

----
# Future Features
- Add photos. I know you can upload photos into cells. So maybe there's an easy way to handle that within the GAS docs...
- Cron Job control
