### Next 3-ish ✅

✅Finish review_2020

Move to Tutorials_Examples > `Google Development/Google App Scripts`

Create dev-gas-stack repo

Update gas-stack repo

Redo as `/completed_walkthrough-12-2020`
- Add Readme with "Jumping back in" section
- Remove `review_2020` All.
- Remove `clasp-cli-completed_walkthrough` (Drive stuff should already be gone)



### To Do...

Start documenting track to build out new gas-stack_v1.0
- Where do `gas-stack_v1.0` files go
- Where / how to we document the origial build of new gas-stack
- the gas-stack.js and gas-stack.gs are the core code, but how do we handle the *development google cloud* applicatoin aspect of it...

### Admin To Do...

- ✅Rebrand repo: decide on name(s) and update repo wide.
  - I say stick with gas-stack its more memorable. NOTE: gas-db_v1.0 (change?)
  - Then, you could make gas-stack_v1.0, rather than 2.0?
