# Gas Stack Development Guide
This README.md is intended to walk you through developing gas-stack with CLASP cli and strategies for work flow.
- `_TO_DO.md` is the project management hub.

# Other dev locations
The google sheets, and other google docs are stored in the `__dev/gas-stack` folder in google drive. [web link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19LRP0tmaG7r84odq3It-jlfe5y8w2Sem).

# Resources
This is the primary doc I've been using for google sheet manipulation with google scripts (.gs). Been having pretty good success with it.
